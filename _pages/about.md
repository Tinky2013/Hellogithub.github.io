HiÔºåI'm **ZIYUE WU (Ê≠¶Â≠êË∂ä)**, a Ph.D student in School of Management, Zhejiang University, advised by Professor [Xi Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/chenxi/). I'm enthusiastic about the interdisciplinary field of Statistics, Machine Learning and Business Studies, and I'm devoted to data-driven managerial practices. 

I recevied my B.S. in Statistics (STATS) and B.M.S. in Information Management and Information Systems (IMIS) in Zhejiang University in 2021. Currently I‚Äôm working on social dynamics modeling, starting from the practical issues and addressing the important challenges of social network analysis at the methodological and applied levels based on different theoretical perspectives. Specifically, my research interests broadly include the following topics:

- **Methodological Research**: Casual inference in machine learning, Graph learning,
Time series forecasting, Interpretable machine learning, Bayesian statistics and Bayesian deep learning.
- **Applied Research**: Social network, Social media, Customer behavior, Precision marketing and product
promotion, Financial technology.

**What if Social Bots Be My Friends? Estimating Causal Effect of Social Bots Using Counterfactual Graph Learning.**

**Ziyue Wu**, Yiqun Zhang, Xi Chen

**Highlights**
- Investigating the impact differences between human and social bots on individuals‚Äô opinion.
- Addressing the absence of counterfactual results in observational network data. 
- Designing a counterfactual graph learning approach to accurately estimate causal effect.
- Discovers diverse influential patterns of different types of opinions expressed by influence sources.
