<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi, I'm **ZIYUE WU (Ê≠¶Â≠êË∂ä)**, a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in the School of Management, Zhejiang University, advised by Professor [Xi Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/chenxi/). I received my **Bachelor's Degree with Dual Majors** in Statistics (STATS) and Information Systems (IS) at Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University, in 2021.  

I'm enthusiastic about the interdisciplinary fields of **Statistics, Machine Learning, and Business Studies**, and devoted to data-driven managerial practices. My research addresses crucial challenges in both academia and practical applications, drawing cutting-edge ideas in the field of Statistics and Computer Science to design novel methodological solutions adapted to these challenges. I also seek to unveil new mechanisms and principles in practical business scenarios, contributing to the advancement of managerial theories.

Specifically, my research interests broadly include the following topics:

- **Methodological Research**: Casual inference in machine learning, Graph learning,
Time series forecasting, Interpretable machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and Bayesian deep learning.
- **Applied Research**: Social network, Social media, Human-AI collaboration, Customer behavior, Precision marketing and product promotion, and Financial technology.

If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to email me at [ziyuewu@zju.edu.cn]("mailto:ziyuewu@zju.edu.cn").

I also collaborate with companies for academic research and practical implementations, most of which are large online E-commerce platforms in China such as Alibaba. My Ph.D. thesis plans to focus on social dynamic modeling, particularly the methodological development and mechanism discovery of individual behaviors in networks.

**Estimating the Effect of Social Bots in Networks Using Counterfactual Graph with Adversarial Learning.**

**Highlights**
- Examines the impact difference between humans and bots in influencing opinions in social networks. 
- Designs an effective approach to conduct counterfactual inference in networks with graph neural networks and adversarial multitask learning.
- The impact differences between bots and humans are overestimated without considering the underlying homophily.
