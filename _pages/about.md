HiÔºåI'm ZIYUE WU, a PhD student in School of Management, Zhejiang University, advised by Professor [Xi Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/chenxi/). I recevied my B.S. in Statistics and B.M.S. in Information Management and Information Systems in Zhejiang University.

I'm really enthusiastic about the interdisciplinary field of Statistics, Machine Learning and Business Studies. My research interests broadly include the following topics:
- Casual Inference in Machine Learning
- Social Network Analysis and Graph Learning
- Time Series Analysis
- Interpretable Machine Learning and Decision Making
- Bayesian Statistics and Bayesian Deep Learning.
