Hi, I'm **Ziyue (Zacc) Wu**, a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in the **School of Management, Zhejiang University**, advised by Professor [Xi Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/chenxi/). I received my **Bachelor's Degree with Dual Majors** in Statistics (STATS) and Information Systems (IS) at Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University.

I'm enthusiastic about the **interdisciplinary fields of Statistics, Machine Learning, and Business Studies**, and devoted to data-driven managerial practices. My research aims to address crucial challenges in both academia and practical applications, drawing cutting-edge ideas in the field of **Statistics** and **Computer Science** to design novel methodological solutions adapted to these challenges. I also seek to unveil new mechanisms and principles in business scenarios, contributing to the advancement of managerial theories.

Specifically, my research interests broadly include the following topics:

* **Methodological Research**: Casual inference in machine learning, Graph learning,
  Time series forecasting, Interpretable machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and Bayesian deep learning.

* **Applied Research**: Social network, Social media, Customer behavior, Human-AI collaboration, Precision marketing and product promotion, and Financial technology.

**If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to email me at ziyuewu@zju.edu.cn**.

I also collaborate with companies for **academic research and practical implementations**, most of which are large online E-commerce or social media platforms in China such as Alibaba. My Ph.D. thesis plans to focus on social dynamic modeling, particularly the methodological development and mechanism discovery of individual behaviors in networks.
